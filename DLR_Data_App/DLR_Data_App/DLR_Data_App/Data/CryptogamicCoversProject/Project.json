        "0": "This is a project to collect parameters that characterize crypogamic covers in the earth system. Organisms that can be studied within this project are bryophytes, cyanobacteria, and lichens. This tool allows for a fast and precise sample data collection, especially on the microscale, if a dGNSS sensor (like the ZED-F9P RTK GNSS USB Dongle (from u-blox, GNSS OEM Future World) with an ANN-MB-Antenna) is connected the mobile device (e.g., tablet or smartphone)."
